Firstly, I created a Fake News Detection project using Python and machine learning techniques.

I used the pandas library to load and process the dataset containing news articles labeled as FAKE or REAL.

For text processing, I used TfidfVectorizer from sklearn to convert news content into numerical features.

I trained a classification model using PassiveAggressiveClassifier to distinguish between real and fake news.

I evaluated the model using accuracy score and confusion matrix to understand its performance.

Finally, this project is useful for understanding the application of NLP and machine learning in identifying misinformation.
